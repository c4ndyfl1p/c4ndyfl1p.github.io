To re-install you should:
Stop the web server systemctl stop apache2
delete or rename the config.php file sitting in the &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;/nextcloud/config directory. I prefer renaming it, just incase cd /var/www/cloud.me.xyz/config sudo mv config.php config.php.bak delete or rename your data directory, that is &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;/nextcloud/data In my case: cd cd /var/www/cloud.me.xyz sudo mv data data.bak
Login to maria db and either drop all the tables in your database to generate a list of SQL statements you need to drop all the tables.</description></item><item><title>Homelab setup (in progress)</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/homelabsetup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/homelabsetup/</guid><description>getting a server
Natural habitats of servers are data-cantres, and they live off of power and internet. However, amongst other things, i wish to have my own cloud and happen to be a perpetually broke college student. While I host a lot of services on my VPS for 400 bucks a month, storage required to save all my media is expensive. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna use a raspberry pi with a hard disk to host my next cloud.</description></item><item><title>On selfhosting and Homelab</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/selfhostingandhomelab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/selfhostingandhomelab/</guid><description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting my very painless journey to self host a number of critical services. What could go wrong?
Critical services:
a cloud system for all my media VPN (wireguard) email server. hehehehe 2 webservers for my projects personal notes/knowledge collection base password manager(yes, a very good idea you see. I definitely know enough about security to be doing this) Maybe would host if I have time:
git video conferencing(over big blue button) This would also serve as a documented wiki for me, because almost every weekend this stuff goes down and I have to figure what happened.</description></item></channel></rss>
