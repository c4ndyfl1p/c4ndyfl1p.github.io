Hi, I'm Aakanksha.
I have an Ender 3 named Amy and I like art.

Here I write about cryptography privacy, autonomy, web development, tryingToMath, and traveling(I spent half a year in the hills in Himachal. Just me, a rucksack, and, my laptop while working remotely as a software dev)

My current area of interest is cryptography, privacy and censorship circumvention.

In the evenings you can find me playing to watching football.

Get in touch with me via email: aakanksha dot mail at proton dot me
