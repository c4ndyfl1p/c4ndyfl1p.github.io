Hi, I'm Aakanksha, and I like computers.
I have an Ender 3 named Amy(formerly Rosa).

Here I write about cryptography privacy, autonomy, web development, tryingToMath, and traveling(I spent half a year in the hills in Himachal. Just me, a rucksack, and of course my laptop while working remotely as a software dev)

Get in touch with me via email: aakanksha.agrawal_asp23@ashoka.edu.in
