The internet was initially intended to be decentralized, primarily for sharing information and resources among academics and researchers. However, between 1997 and 2007, the internet underwent significant changes driven by the economy and people's attempts to monetize it.

The early thoughts on the economics of the internet were pay-per-click and pay-only-to-your-service-provider models. These models failed to take off, leading to the creation of PayPal by Musk and Thiel. PayPal became successful because it did not have to conform to banking laws and was not storing any money but only processing transactions.

The invention of social networks was the next stage, focusing on human relations rather than just bookmarking web pages or services. Many such networks were tried and made, but they failed because they could not figure out how to monetize them. Even after Google showed how data exhaust works, social networks didn't work. Focused services still paid better than the social networks.

Google and DoubleClick played a crucial role in developing the modern internet economy through their innovative advertising models. Google's AdWords, introduced in 2000, and DoubleClick's DART (Dynamic Advertising Reporting and Targeting), introduced in 1998, revolutionized online advertising. They allowed advertisers to target users based on their search queries, browsing history, and other behavioral data, creating a powerful ad network that could reach millions of users across the internet.

Google's acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 further solidified their dominance in the online advertising market. DoubleClick's DART platform allowed advertisers to track the performance of their ads and optimize their campaigns based on real-time data. Google integrated DART's technology into its AdSense and AdWords platforms, creating a more effective and efficient advertising model.

Tumblr was launched in 2007 as a microblogging and social networking site, allowing users to create short-form blogs and share multimedia content. Tumblr became known as a hub for subcultures, including fandoms, artists, and social justice activists. It created a woke culture, and a lot of discussions got created over culture. Tumblr and Blogspot began having an outsized influence on popular narrative.

On the other hand, 4chan was founded in 2003 as an imageboard, where users could post images and discuss various topics anonymously. 4chan became known for its unregulated nature, allowing people to post anything they wanted without fear of consequences. This led to controversial content and discussions, including trolling, harassment, and hate speech.

Tumblr and 4chan represent opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to online communities. Tumblr is known for its focus on creating respectful, safe spaces for users to be who they want to be, while 4chan is known for its emphasis on anonymity and pushing boundaries. Despite their differences, both platforms have had a significant impact on the internet and popular culture. Tumblr has been credited with popularizing memes, while 4chan has been associated with the creation of internet subcultures like Anonymous and the alt-right.

Today, the internet has become centralized, with platforms like Instagram and YouTube serving as de facto town centers for information. Those who control these platforms have control over the information that people receive, leading to a skewed representation of the truth. The internet has changed drastically from its initial decentralized form, driven by the economy and people's attempts to monetize it.
