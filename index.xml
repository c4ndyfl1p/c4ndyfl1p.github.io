To re-install you should:
Stop the web server systemctl stop apache2
delete or rename the config.php file sitting in the &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;/nextcloud/config directory. I prefer renaming it, just incase cd /var/www/cloud.me.xyz/config sudo mv config.php config.php.bak delete or rename your data directory, that is &amp;lt;directory&amp;gt;/nextcloud/data In my case: cd cd /var/www/cloud.me.xyz sudo mv data data.bak
Login to maria db and either drop all the tables in your database to generate a list of SQL statements you need to drop all the tables.</description></item><item><title>Homelab setup (in progress)</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/homelabsetup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/homelabsetup/</guid><description>getting a server
Natural habitats of servers are data-cantres, and they live off of power and internet. However, amongst other things, i wish to have my own cloud and happen to be a perpetually broke college student. While I host a lot of services on my VPS for 400 bucks a month, storage required to save all my media is expensive. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna use a raspberry pi with a hard disk to host my next cloud.</description></item><item><title>&lt;wiki> | Using and external disk as a data directory for nextcloud</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/wiki-nexcloudmediadirectory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/wiki-nexcloudmediadirectory/</guid><description>This article is not a well though out writeup- rather a dump of what to do when I fuck up again and need to reinstall my nextcloud.
I provisioned a 60 GB external hardisk to serve as my data folder in nextcloud.
Check if the external device is mounted df -h It isnt
check for storage decides: lsblk Now if you find the external disk, it&amp;rsquo;ll be in /dev, special filesystem that holds a reference to every device attached on your disk</description></item><item><title>On selfhosting and Homelab</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/selfhostingandhomelab/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/selfhostingandhomelab/</guid><description>Here I&amp;rsquo;ll be documenting my very painless journey to self host a number of critical services. What could go wrong?
Critical services:
a cloud system for all my media VPN (wireguard) email server. hehehehe 2 webservers for my projects personal notes/knowledge collection base password manager(yes, a very good idea you see. I definitely know enough about security to be doing this) Maybe would host if I have time:
git video conferencing(over big blue button) This would also serve as a documented wiki for me, because almost every weekend this stuff goes down and I have to figure what happened.</description></item><item><title>Real Time Web App #1 Bi-directional Communication: Server, The CandyMan</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/realtimewebappbidirectioncommunication/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/realtimewebappbidirectioncommunication/</guid><description>Real Time Web App #1 Bi-directional Communication: Server, The CandyMan How do websites usually work? You click something: a button, a link, a hyperlink, a form button i.e you request for a resource from a web-server, in return the website gives you some text, an image, or some other media, more specifically a constructed web document, and a 2xx status code i.e the web-server responds to your request with some resource.</description></item><item><title>Mein Browserland #1: The web, cookies, authentication</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/meinbrowserland1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/meinbrowserland1/</guid><description>The web is a tangled mess; And securing it, no matter what we try, appears to be a hard task, if not impossible. Before talking about HOW to go about securing it, or writing and deploying secure web applications, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why the web is a tangled mess.
The web, as we know it, is ever-evolving and came about by decades of working on existing features. If a feature was ever released over the web, it was permanent and you could not just get rid of it.</description></item><item><title>Aes in CBC mode</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/cryptopals-set2-challenge11/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/cryptopals-set2-challenge11/</guid><description>AES-CBC | I still see penguins I think this was a very experimental exercise.
edit: I did something dumb, spent more time than i&amp;rsquo;d care to admit in agony before realising the dumb thing, hence this post exists. Scroll to the bottom to save yourself some pain.
Task (cryptopals set2 challenge 11):
Write an encryption oracle with encrypts a plaintext with AES in ECB mode half the time and CBC mode other half.</description></item><item><title>3D printing and wizardy</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/3dprintingandwizardy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/3dprintingandwizardy/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s covid, there was very less of stuff I could do.

My body finally registers that I ranked up to &amp;ldquo;the global elite rank&amp;rdquo;. As I remove my headphones after a long Counter-Strike gaming streak; another shock comes my way. I feel myself getting sucked in by a wormhole like force accompanied by a sharp, ear-splitting sound which gradually decreases in amplitude rendering me nauseated. I feel thrown into another world.</description></item><item><title>3D printing Face Shields for the neighborhood</title><link>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/3dprintingfaceshields/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://c4ndyfl1p.github.io/posts/3dprintingfaceshields/</guid><description>The maker community at large came together in the time of crisis to design and develop hackable oxygen tanks, face shields and they open-sources them.
