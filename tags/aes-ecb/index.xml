edit: I did a dumb thing, hence this post exists. Scroll to the bottom to save yourself some pain.
Task (cryptopals set2 challenge 11):
Write an encryption oracle with encrypts a plaintext with AES in ECB mode half the time and CBC mode other half.
Write a detection oractle, which given a ciphertext, detects if it&amp;rsquo;s been encrypted with ECB mode with CBC mode.</description></item></channel></rss>
